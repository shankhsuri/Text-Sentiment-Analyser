# Text-Sentiment-Analyser

Scrape twitter tweets [Or copy paste] to build a dataset of tweets or choose
facebook comments or any other social networking website for scrapping
content. Size should be 100 observations [More samples will give better results].
Label dataset with sentiments (you can choose sentiment label names and number
of sentiments).
Build a sentiment analysis model on the dataset.
Deploy model as flask app.

What steps will you take next to improve performance and demonstrate the
results on taking these steps? Why did you take those steps? Did it improve
performance on ten tweets taken from twitter in previous steps?
